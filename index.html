      <p>I am Bibek Hamal, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Recently graduated with a degree in Information Technology, <br />I have a solid foundation in software development and a strong enthusiasm for building scalable, user-friendly applications.
        During my academic journey, I honed my skills through hands-on projects, coursework, and self-directed learning. I am currently expanding my expertise by learning Java, further diversifying my technical skill set.<br /> My projects reflect my ability to solve real-world problems, write clean and efficient code, and adapt to new technologies quickly.
        As a fresh graduate, I bring a fresh perspective, a hunger for learning, and a commitment to continuous improvement. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and grow as a developer in a dynamic and challenging environment.</p>

      <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br /> Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting,<br> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
